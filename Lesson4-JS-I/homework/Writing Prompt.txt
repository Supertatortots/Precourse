Variables

Variables can be called information for the computer, giving context on what certain things mean.
For example, var value = "1", then it knows that whenever the term value comes up, it'll mean "1".

Strings

Strings are the text of a variable and is a major component of variables.

For example, if var money = "20", "20" would be the string.

Functions

Functions can be considered giving a set of directions to the computer. The advantage of them is that instead of
having to input the same equations over and over again, you can simply tell the computer to use a function that's been made earlier.

if statements

If statements is telling the computer to do "x" when "y" has happened. It will only do it in a yes/no situation, so if "y" isn't completely what "y" is supposed to be, then
it won't do x.

Booleans

Booleans is a value that can only be one of two values. True or false.
For example, if given the prompt 1 > 2, the computer would return it as false as 1 is not greater than 2.
If given 3 > 2, then it will return true, as 3 is greater than 2.
